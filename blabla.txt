eleting a repository (public and private) will remove all wikis, issues, and comments associated with the repository. 

Deleting a fork doesn't affect the upstream (original) repository. 

With a few exceptions, there is no way to restore a deleted repository. 

If you're not sure about permanently deleting your GitHub repo, a safer bet is to archive it. This way, you can unarchive it later on and pick up where you left off.
